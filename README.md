# pptx-to-html5

A Python tool for converting PowerPoint presentations (.pptx) to interactive HTML5 websites with accurate positioning.

## Features

- 🎨 Convert PowerPoint presentations to standalone HTML5 websites
- 📐 **Accurate element positioning** - Preserves the layout and positioning of text boxes, images, and other elements from your slides
- 📱 Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- ⌨️ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space, Home, End)
- 👆 Touch/swipe support for mobile devices
- 📝 Optional speaker notes inclusion
- 🎯 Clean, modern UI with smooth transitions
- 🔄 Progress bar and slide counter
- 💻 Command-line interface for easy automation
- 📋 **Bullet point support** - Multi-level bullets with proper indentation

## How It Works

The converter extracts individual shapes (text boxes, images, etc.) from your PowerPoint slides along with their exact positions, sizes, and formatting. These are then rendered as positioned HTML elements, maintaining the original slide layout.

- **Text elements**: Preserved with font size, style (bold/italic), and alignment
- **Bullet points**: Multi-level bullets (•, ◦, ▪) with proper indentation based on paragraph level
- **Images**: Embedded as base64-encoded data URIs with automatic format detection
- **Positioning**: Converted to percentage-based CSS positioning for responsive scaling

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Dependencies: python-pptx, Pillow, Jinja2

## Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shafe123/pptx-to-html5.git
cd pptx-to-html5
pip install -e .
```

### Development installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Command Line

Convert a PowerPoint presentation to HTML5:

```bash
pptx-to-html presentation.pptx
```

Specify an output directory:

```bash
pptx-to-html presentation.pptx -o output_folder
```

Include speaker notes in the output:

```bash
pptx-to-html presentation.pptx --include-notes
```

### Python API

```python
from pptx_to_html5.converter import PowerPointToHTML5Converter

# Create converter
converter = PowerPointToHTML5Converter("presentation.pptx")

# Convert to HTML5
output_path = converter.convert("output_folder", include_notes=False)

print(f"Presentation converted to: {output_path}")
```

## Output Structure

The converter creates a self-contained website with:

- `index.html` - Main presentation file
- `styles.css` - Styling and layout
- `script.js` - Navigation and interactivity

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the presentation.

## Navigation Controls

- **Arrow Keys** (← →): Navigate between slides
- **Space Bar**: Next slide
- **Home**: Go to first slide
- **End**: Go to last slide
- **Mouse/Touch**: Use on-screen buttons or swipe gestures
